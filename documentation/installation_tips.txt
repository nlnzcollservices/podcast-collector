Before running:

1. Check secrets setting in alma_tools
2. Make ros_apy.py with your Rosetta api password (this one, which you had on the day when you got Rosetta API permissions)
3. Check paths to secrets in Alma Tools. Run exmples there separately.
4. Check paths to downloader in podcasts0_harvestes.py
5. Check if you have the last downloader_file_modified version. Try to download something.
6 Check if you have working exiftool.exe and pyexiftool. Test from command line. Try from command line "exiftool /your/path/to/file".
