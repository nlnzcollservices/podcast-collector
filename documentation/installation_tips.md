Before running for the first time:

1. Check secrets settings in alma_tools
2. Make  sure that ros_apy.py with your Rosetta api password (this one, which you had on the day when you got Rosetta API permissions) is in your secrets folder.
3. Check paths to secrets in Alma Tools. Run exmples there separately.
4. Check paths to downloader in podcasts0_harvestes.py
5. Check if you have the last downloader_file_modified version. Try to download something with it.
6. Check if you have working exiftool.exe and pyexiftool. Test from command line. Try from command line "exiftool /your/path/to/file".
